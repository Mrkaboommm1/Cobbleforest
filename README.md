Cobbleforest
============

A general repository for CF stuff.


This repository was created to assist me in developing the CF server. If you are not a member of cobbleforest.com or anything associated with Cobbleforest, then this repository is not important to you.

From here I will be able to test and fix scripts written for the server and get feedback and statistics on how everything is running.

If you're wondering why .sk files appear from time to time, it is because a portion of our commands run off of Skript, a Bukkit plugin created by Njol (https://github.com/Njol/). This plugin allows us to create and update plugins faster than what would be possible with Java alone.
